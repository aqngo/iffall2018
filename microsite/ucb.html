	<div class="copy"><p>During her time at Second City and Improv Olympic in Chicago, Poehler studied alongside Matt Besser under Del Close and Charna Halpern. Poehler and Besser joined with Ian Roberts and Matt Walsh to found the Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB). The group performed sketch and improv around Chicago before moving to New York City in 1996. After moving to New York, the group scored a TV gig, appearing as sketch regulars on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, often playing her recurring role as Andy Richter's little sister, Stacy. Other early members of UCB included Horatio Sanz, Adam McKay, Rick Roman, and Neil Flynn.</p>

	<p>In 1998, Comedy Central debuted the group's eponymous half-hour sketch comedy series. During the show's second season, the group opened an improv theatre/training center in New York City at 161 W. 22nd Street, occupying the space of a former strip club. The UCB theatre held shows seven nights a week in addition to offering classes in sketch comedy writing and improv. In the summer of 2000, Comedy Central canceled the Upright Citizens Brigade program after its third season, though the UCB Theatre continues to operate. The foursome continues to work together in many projects and frequently perform together in live improv shows at their comedy theatres in both New York and Los Angeles.</p></div>
