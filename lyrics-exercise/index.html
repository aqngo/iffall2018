	<h1>Moon River</h1>
	<h2>As sung by Frank Ocean</h2>
<p>1, 2<br>
Moon river wider than a mile<br>
I'm crossing you in style someday <em>(someday, day)</em><br>
A dream maker <em>(maker, maker)</em><br>
My heartbreaker <em>(you heartbreaker)</em><br>
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' that way <em>(the same, the same)</em>
</p>
Two drifters off to see the world<br>
There's such a crazy world to see<br>
We're all chasin' after all the same<br>
Chasing after our rainbow's end
</p>
<p>Moon river wider than a mile<br>
Crossin' in style someday<br>
My dream maker<br>
Heartbreaker<br>
Wherever you're going I'm going the same<br>
Two drifters off to see the world<br>
It's such a crazy world you'll see <em>(What I see, who I become)</em><br>
What I see, who I become<br>
We're all chasin' after our end<br>
Chasin' after our ends
</p>
<p>Life's just around the bend, my friend</p>
<p>Moon river and me</p>
